<h2>The Rules of Retro Bowl Liberty</h2>
<p>Playing Retro Bowl Liberty follows the same rules as traditional bowling. Each player takes turns rolling their ball down the lane, aiming to knock down as many pins as possible. The game is played in frames, with players getting two chances to knock down all the pins. The player with the highest score at the end of the game emerges as the victorious bowler.</p>
